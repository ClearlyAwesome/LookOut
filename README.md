# LookOut
An IOS app to find near by friends 

Lookout. It is an iOS app built to locate friends in real-time. The app takes in userâ€™s current location and finds nearby friends. Chat messenger is integrated in the app to allow the user to chat with his/her friends. An SoS feature is implemented to allow user to send emergency alert to his chosen contacts. The unique feature that put lookout out of the box is User also has a privacy setting, which allows him/her to stop sharing his/her location from the app. The app was built as effort to explore IOS development and the mapkit.
